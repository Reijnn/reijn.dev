__Software Engineer & Military Reservist__

A dedicated Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, I specialize in web development and am well-versed in cloud technologies, particularly Microsoft Azure. Certified in Scrum methodologies, I bring agility and efficiency to every project, ensuring robust and scalable solutions. Alongside my technical role, I serve with commitment in the military reserve, an experience that has instilled in me discipline, leadership, and the ability to thrive under pressure. Balancing both the tech and defense sectors, I bring a unique blend of skills, ensuring innovation, resilience, and steadfast dedication to any team or project I undertake.
